# HalfaHeart

HalfaHeart is the core plugin for the HalfaHeart Minecraft server.

The server is simple, you join the game, and have half a heart of health (1 health point).   
At spawn you will click the RTP sign and teleport to a random spot in the world.   
The server's difficulty is set to hard.

If you die, similair to hardcore mode, you lose all of your belongings and teleport back to spawn.   
From here, you can RTP again to a new random spot.

In the player tab list, you can see the amount of times you have died, plus the current days you have been alive for (this number is not totally accurate)

Check out the server at **play.halfaheart.tk**
